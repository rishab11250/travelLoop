## 🚀 Core Vision
Traveloop isn't just a trip planner; it's a **travel-operating-system**. Developed in a high-intensity 8-hour sprint, it addresses the chaotic nature of planning multi-city global expeditions. By combining high-fidelity destination data with granular financial tracking, Traveloop ensures that your only concern is the journey, not the logistics.

## ✨ Deep-Dive Feature Set

### 🔐 Ironclad Security & User Lifecycle
*   **JWT-Driven Auth:** Stateful session management using JSON Web Tokens with a 30-day persistence.
*   **Encrypted Identities:** Industry-standard `bcryptjs` hashing for all sensitive credentials.
*   **Ownership Isolation:** Every API request is verified against a trip-ownership matrix, preventing unauthorized data access.
*   **Admin Command Center:** Exclusive analytics suite for platform administrators to monitor global travel trends.

### 📍 Intelligent Discovery
*   **Massive Seed Dataset:** Access a curated database of **30+ iconic cities** and **150+ activities** (optimized for Indian and International travelers).
*   **Fuzzy Search Engine:** Real-time search across cities, countries, and activity descriptions with high-performance SQL indexing.
*   **Regional curation:** Discover trips based on region (Asia, Europe, etc.) or cost-index popularity.

### 🗺️ Precision Itinerary Builder
*   **Logical Partitioning:** Break trips into logical segments: **Hotels, Transport, Food, and Activities.**
*   **Temporal Logic:** Date-aware sections that automatically align with your trip's start and end boundaries.
*   **Visual Timelines:** A day-wise layout that separates "What to do" from "What to spend."

### 💰 Financial Intelligence
*   **Real-time Aggregation:** Backend-calculated summaries showing `Total Planned Budget` vs `Actual Spending`.
*   **Itemized Invoicing:** Generate a professional-grade audit trail of every dollar (or rupee) spent during the trip.
*   **Budget Guardrails:** Visual indicators of remaining balances to keep your expedition on track.

### 📋 Smart Utilities
*   **Categorized Checklist:** Pre-defined categories (Documents, Electronics, Health) to automate your packing routine.
*   **Trip Journaling:** A dedicated space for day-specific reminders, local contacts, and fleeting memories.
*   **Social Connectivity:** Toggle `is_public` to share your masterpiece with the global Traveloop community.

## 🔌 API Ecosystem

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Session creation & JWT issue | No |
| `GET` | `/api/trips` | User's trips with budget aggregates | Yes |
| `GET` | `/api/trips/community` | Public trip discovery feed | No |
| `GET` | `/api/expenses/trip/:id/invoice` | Itemized billing breakdown | Owner |
| `GET` | `/api/cities?q=Delhi` | Fuzzy search for destinations | No |

## 🗄 Database Intelligence

The system utilizes 8 core tables with a Star-Schema relationship:
- **`users`**: Root entity with admin escalation.
- **`trips`**: Central pivot for all user plans.
- **`trip_sections`**: Temporal segments of a trip.
- **`expenses`**: Individual financial records.
- **`cities` & `activities`**: Master data for discovery.

*All foreign keys are indexed for sub-100ms query performance.*
